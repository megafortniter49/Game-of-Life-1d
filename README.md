# Game of Life 1d

This project is an implementation of a one-dimensional version of Conway's Game of Life using Pygame. It includes a user interface for starting the game, adjusting the speed of generation, and displaying information about the current generation and population.

## Features
- **Customizable World Length**: Users can define the length of the world.
- **Initial State Configuration**: Users can choose to input the initial state manually or generate it randomly.
- **Speed Slider**: Allows users to adjust the speed of the generations.
- **UI Information**: Displays the current generation, population, and a button to start the game.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Setup
To run this game, you'll need to have Python and Pygame installed. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Game
To start the game, run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python code.py
```
When prompted, choose the method to initialize the world and enter the desired length of the world.

## Controls
- Left Mouse Click on "Start" Button: Start the game.
- Left Mouse Click and Drag on Speed Slider: Adjust the speed of generations.

## Exiting the Game
Close the window or use the keyboard interrupt (`Ctrl+C` in the terminal) to exit the game. Upon exiting, the terminal will display the total number of generations and the final population.
